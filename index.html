        <h2 id="intro">Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
          Hello my name is Samantha and today I'd like to introduce some of my
          favorite bands, genres, and favorite songs. Music has been around for
          thousands of years, and it's evolved over time. Before we had our own
          language, we made simple instruments likely made out of bones and
          other materials. Even though we hadn't develop a structured language
          yet, we may have used our voices to express our emotions and feelings.
          I'd like to imagine humans were always expressive and creative in
          their own way. Bringing us back to the current times, there are
          <em>so many</em> genres to explore. Some are mainstream like metal,
          rap, and, pop. Others are a bit more niche, like glitchcore, shoegaze,
          and nu-metal. If it's okay, I'd like to introduce some bands and
          genres that resonate with me. Without further ado, let's get into it!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row-2" id="genres">
        <div>
          <h2 id="glitchcore">Glitchcore:</h2>
          <p>
            According to
            <a
              href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Glitchcore"
              target="_blank"
              >Aesthetic Wiki</a
            >,
            <em
              >"Glitchcore as a 2020s music genre is inspired by the dance music
              vibes of the mid to late 2000s and the sped-up aesthetics of early
              2010s nightcore."</em
            >
            This genre is one of my favorite genres to listen to. It often has a
            lot going on within their songs. There's a lot of unfamiliar
            instruments, often with a beat to it. Then there's the vocals, they
            often sound ethereal and otherwordly. Yet somehow some songs bring a
            slight melancholic feeling to them. A good example of this would be
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qNgbIGsrtM"
              target="_blank"
              >4 Morant (better luck next time) - Doja Cat</a
            >
            (explicit). On the other hand, glitchcore can also feel like you're
            traveling through a galaxy. A song I like that represents this would
            be
            <a
              href="https://youtu.be/Z0NGdLr4img?si=wYaAXvO0iNDop5sL"
              target="_blank"
              >Suffocation - Crystal Castles</a
            >. I hope these two examples gave a good idea of what glitchcore
            exactly is! Moving onto the next genre is shoegaze!
          </p>
          <h3>Glitchcore Artists:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Crystal Castles</li>
            <li>Odetari (often explicit)</li>
            <li>Marluxiam</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 id="shoegaze">Shoegaze:</h2>
          <p>
            Continuing onto shoegaze, it is also one of my favorite genres. In
            my opinion, shoegaze focuses more on the soft voices, mixed with
            heavier rock instrumentals added in. Referencing
            <a
              href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Shoegaze?so=search"

              >Aesthetic Wiki</a
            >
            again,
            <em
              >"Shoegaze is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the
              late 80s. The genre is characterized by its shimmering vocals,
              reverberating guitars, and textural distortion..."</em
            >"Shoegaze is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the
            late 80s. The genre is characterized by its shimmering vocals,
            reverberating guitars, and textural distortion...". A song that
            strongly represents this genre to a T is
            <a
              href="https://youtu.be/hbwyCQo2xDc?si=gUGl0RHptVnMzw9p"
              target="_blank"
              >Your Face - Wisp</a
            >. This music makes me feel less alone, where my thoughts are loud
            and my hope is none. I feel understood when I hear this type of
            music. It feels like a defeated, sad anger. Maybe acceptance of a
            situation.
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4y13B_SSEo"
              target="_blank"
              >A Sad Cartoon - Loathe</a
            >
            is another song that I deeply resonate with. While I struggle to
            interpret the lyrics and create my own meaning from it, the feelings
            I get when I listen to this song while driving is like no other. I
            hope you can appreciate this song as much as I do.
          </p>
          <h3>Shoegaze Artists:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Mareux</li>
            <li>Loathe</li>
            <li>my bloody valentine</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 id="nu-metal">Nu-Metal:</h2>
          <p>
            Nu-metal is described as
            <em
              >"often playing on pure shock factor or raw emotion with songs
              about... otherwise controversial subjects"</em
            >, from
            <a
              href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Nu-Metal#Music"
              target="_blank"
              >Aesthetic Wiki</a
            >
            as well. Lately, I've more aligned with nu-metal compared to the
            other genres. I like it's heavy vocals and guitar rich music. Some
            nu-metal music can lean less on the original metal genre and instead
            add in a more transcendant feeling, a bit like shoegaze.
            <a
              href="https://youtu.be/jtBmowJLc94?si=0qq-idl3wLg0Zgt3"
              target="_blank"
              >Cherry Waves - Deftones</a
            >
            handles this example very well and has been one of my favorite songs
            for many years. If we want to explore a more true to genre song that
            represents nu-metal, then the song
            <a
              href="https://youtu.be/kXYiU_JCYtU?si=EV9XP28qttemHsNB"
              target="_blank"
              >Numb - Linkin Park</a
            >
            is a great example. In this song he really expresses his feeling of
            depression and inferiority. While some may view it as controversial,
            I now see it as a cry for help that many listeners missed. I'd like
            to touch more on this artist in the next topic.
          </p>
          <h3>Nu-Metal Artists:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Linkin Park</li>
            <li>Deftones</li>
            <li>System of a Down</li>
          </ul>

      <div class="row-3" id="artists">
        <div>
          <h2 id="linkin-park">Linkin Park and Chester Bennington:</h2>
          <p>
            While I don't know much about the entire band, I do know they
            created many top hit songs such as "One Step Closer", "Crawling",
            and "In The End". Chester, born in Phoenix, Arizona, March 20, 1976,
            died on July 20, 2017. He was the lead vocalist within the band. He
            often struggled with depression and substance abuse for the majority
            of his life. From ages 7-13, he was abused inappropriately by an
            older male friend. Despite what he went through, he was a beacon of
            hope for millions of people who felt just like him - depressed,
            suicidal, and lost. Chester will always have a special place in my
            heart, and my heart goes out to the millions of people who loved him
            just as much as I do. Even though he is no longer with us, he is
            still so prevalent in many people's lives today. That is why I will
            always respect and love their band, and if you haven't listened to
            any of his music, I'd highly recommend it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 id="deftones">Deftones:</h2>
          <p>
            Deftones might be one of my top bands ever. The band created in
            Sacramento, California, formed in 1988 consists of 5 members. Chino
            Moreno (frontman), Stephen Carptenter (lead guitarist), Abe
            Cunningham (drummer), Chi Cheng (bassist), and Frank Delgado
            (keyboardist and turntablist). To me, Deftone's ability to create
            such diverse music is like no other. They've contributed to so many
            subgenres of rock and metal. Whenever I hear the band play, I'm
            immersed and I feel all of the emotions they convey. It's my dream
            to one day to meet them in real life and hear them play live. I know
            many of their songs by heart and I've been a fan for years. They've
            inspired me so much and are often the reason for my motivation to
            keep on pushing through my challenges.
